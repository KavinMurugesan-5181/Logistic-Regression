# Logistic-Regression
Logistic regression is a mathematical model used for binary categorization. It predicts the probability that an instance will belong to a specific class using the sigmoid function, ensuring outcomes between 0 and 1. The model computes a linear combination of the input features, transforms it using the sigmoid, and then optimizes its coefficients using techniques such as gradient descent in order to minimize the log loss. The decision boundary that separates the classes is established by these coefficients. When solving machine learning problems involving binary outcomes, Logistic Regression is a popular tool due to its adaptability, interpretability, and ease of application across several domains. Regularization is a way to prevent overfitting.
